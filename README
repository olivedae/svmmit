    $ What is svmmit?

      Svmmit (pronounced summit) allows for expressive
      and minimal searches of commits and
      revisions for projects using SVN.


    $ e.g.

      Currently working on a issue and discover
      that there appears to be missing files
      and/or code. In the example below, the file was
      deleted in r12376

      $ svmmit ~/branch --limit none ^/class\s+(SomeClass|TestClass|ExampleClass)/
      $ Mentioned in: r12340, Related modifications: r12345, r12376
      $ > info {r12345, r12376}
      $ -- Emits info about the branches and so on --
      $ > knit {r12340, r12345}
      $ -- Emits full file --
